appDesciption=Dijkstra's algorithm is used for calculating shortest route from the start point to the destination point connected with the other points (nodes). Start point will be considered point 'A' and the destination point will be the last point/node in the matrix. Firstly you should input number of points/nodes into the field so that number is between 3 and 26. Then you should input actual distances between the nodes. If you input character '#' for a distance it will be considered that two of that nodes are not connected. Also, if you leave some fields empty, app will fill those missing fields with the correspondent entry or if there is none it will enter '#' character, so you don't need to input the same value twice :)
